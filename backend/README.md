The Odin Project Photo Tagging App (Where's Waldo Clone) https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/nodejs-where-s-waldo-a-photo-tagging-app

This backend was built using MongoDB but it is no longer in use, it currently uses (/backend-prisma) with a Prisma/PostgreSQL database.

The website is currently hosted on my Netlify: https://daltonoswald-photo-tagging-app.netlify.app/
