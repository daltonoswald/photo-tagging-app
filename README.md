# photo-tagging-app

The Odin Project Photo Tagging App (Where's Waldo Clone)
https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/nodejs-where-s-waldo-a-photo-tagging-app

This was built using React as the frontend and Prisma/PostgreSQL as the backend.
It was originally built using MongoDB which is still in the file system (/backend) but currently uses (/backend-prisma) to host the backend on Railway.

The website is currently hosted on my Netlify:
